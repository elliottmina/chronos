# TODO

* rebuild index
* Sometimes the suggstions UL gets the click instead of the LI.

## Backlog
* Shared configuration system for app and modules
  * Configure hours/week, hours/day.
* sub projects
  * Perhaps just configurable delimiters (|:/.][)
* Remove less text and JSON tabs.
* Get rid of tabs.  Show overview and log together.
* Show volume per project/sub project for day, week, month, quarter year
* Bug: JSON exporter does not include full data with large data sets.  Likely exceeding maximum string size.
* Bug: sometimes tasks are no properly set when repeating.
* Persister as a replaceable module (SQLite, XHR, git)
