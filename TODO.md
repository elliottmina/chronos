# TODO

* rebuild index
* Sometimes the suggstions UL gets the click instead of the LI.

## Backlog

* Make it more obvious when you are editing a span.
* Make decimal or minute display configuration based
* Configure hours/week, hours/day.
* sub projects
  * Perhaps just configurable delimiters (|:/.][)
* Show volume per project/sub project for day, week, month, quarter year
* Bug: JSON exporter does not include full data with large data sets.  Likely exceeding maximum string size.
* Bug: sometimes tasks are no properly set when repeating.
* Allow repeat of summary
* copy button for time
* Edit tasks
* Suggest tasks
* Allow text selection key shortcuts
* Track time elapsed (start of first entry vs end of last entry) vs time worked
* Avatar with words of encouragement?  Also coach Z.
* Move today's items to the top
* Sound no longer plays

## Future

* Get rid of jquery
* Persister as a replaceable module (SQLite, XHR, git)
* Move current date to App, so modules don't have to track it

## Done

* Removed JSON and text summaries
* Fixed issue where saving a span caused the first project to be selected.
* App remembers your work-in-progress span, in case you refresh the browser.
